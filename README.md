# LeetCode Solutions

A collection of my solutions to **LeetCode** problems using **Python**.
Each solution is well-structured and documented for learning and interview preparation.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

* Each problem is stored in a separate `.py` file.

* File naming convention:

  ```
  {problem_number}_{problem_name}.py
  ```

  Example:
  `1_two_sum.py`

* For each problem, I aim to provide:

  * **Brute Force Solution** (to understand the basic logic)
  * **Optimized Solution** (to achieve better time complexity)
